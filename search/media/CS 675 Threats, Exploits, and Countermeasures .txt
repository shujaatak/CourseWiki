CS 675 Threats, Exploits, and Countermeasures Introduction and review. Computer security basics. Attack and defense basics. Protocols. Setting ethical boundaries.
      Secure coding techniques I. Worrying about buffer overflow, stacks, and arbitrary memory writes.
      Secure coding techniques II. Format abuses, race conditions, TOCTOU.
      Vulnerability discovery. Fuzzing techniques for finding security flaws in protocols and program input. White-box vs. evolutionary fuzzing.
      Penetration testing. Limits of network discovery.
      Writing exploits and shellcodes. Encapsulating the payloads.
      Midterm project presentations
      More exploits. Countermeasures. Reversing exploits and protectors/packers. Rootkits for OS and execution environments.
      Attacking the infrastructure: routing, DNS, etc.
      Countering the infrastructure threat.
      Ethical hacking: what are the limits, revisited.  Malware herding: think globally.
      Cryptographic attacks on hosts and infrastructure.
      Attacking small devices (e.g. phones, handhelds).  Special topics-(Papers from a recent conference)
