CS 544 Health Informatics Introduction to health informatics. Overview of field, relation to bioinformatics.
      Collection and flow of health data (including meaningful use and PPACA).
            Including claims data, clinician-generated data, and information exchange.
 
      EMRs, PHRs, and data standards (narrative vs. structured data, ontologies).
       Data use, interpretation (what is a diagnosis really?) and challenges (including data quality).  Managing and using EMR data for research
      Methods for evaluation. How can we compare systems and determine if a project is successful?
            
            Tutorial on statistical techniques based on student background/needs.
Midterm presentation of case studies.       HIPAA, IRBs, and de-identification. We will discuss the rules and regulations governing health research and, from a practical standpoint, how to preserve privacy when conducting research. Pharmacovigilance and drug discovery  Journal club discussion of recent papers in health informatics  Decision Support       Public health informatics Presentation of final projects
