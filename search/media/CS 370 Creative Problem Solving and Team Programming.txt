CS 370 Creative Problem Solving and Team ProgrammingIntroduction to competitive programming and working with
      online judges.  Fast input.
      Working in teams:
Pre-contest preparation, dividing the work, developing test cases.
      Numerical algorithms, part 1:
extracting digits of an integer without strings, storing visited
states in a lookup table.
      Numerical algorithms, part 2:
efficiently find factors and primes and to solve equations
numerically.
      String manipulation; recursive generating permutations
      and combinations of a set.
      Using memoization combined with lists/sets to find all
      optimal solutions to a problem.
      Overcoming differences in languages; files, strings, and
      bitwise operators.
      Creating good test cases.
Implementing an algorithm for which there is no standard approach.
      Dynamic programming, part 1:
Recognizing problems that fit DP; comparison to memoization.
      Dynamic programming, part 2:
Practicing problems.
