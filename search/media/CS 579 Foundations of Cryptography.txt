CS 579 Foundations of CryptographyIntroduction.  The setting of symmetric encryption.
      Perfect secrecy.  One-time-pad encryption.
	Characterizations of perfect secrecy.  Towards the
	computational approach:  Indistinguishability-based
	definitions of secrecy. 
      Limitations of perfect secrecy: Shannon's theorem and
      the need for the computational approach. Concrete security and
      asymptotic security. 
      
	Computational indistinguishability and (computationally)
	secure symmetric-encryption.  Pseudo-random number generators
	(PRNG, More on pseudo-randomness: Properties of PRNGs.
	Pseudo-random functions (PRFs) and pseudo-random permutations
	(PRPs and strong PRPs/blockciphers). The Feistel transform and
	the design of DES.
      Applications of PRFs/s-PRPs: Chosen-Plaintext Attacks
	(CPA) security. Modes of operation:  CTR, OFB, CFB, CBC.
      Data integrity and cryptographic hash functions
	(collision resistant Data origin and Message Authentication Codes (MACs).
      Midterm.
      Toward asymmetric cryptography: The key exchange
	problem.  Merkle puzzles. Review of basic facts about finite
	groups.
      More number-theoretic facts. Easy and hard problems
	in The Pohlig-Hellman cipher and Shamir's no-key protocol.
	The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol. ElGamal encryption.  Quadratic residuosity
	in Digital signatures and the notion of Public-Key
      Infrastructure.
